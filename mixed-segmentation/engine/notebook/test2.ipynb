      "Summary of findings:\n",
      "1. What demographics drive outcomes?\n",
      "   - Higher income bins (2, 3, 4, and 5) and exposure count are significant positive predictors of site visits (p < 0.05).\n",
      "   - R-squared for the model is 0.400, suggesting that 39.97% of the variance in site visits is explained by these predictors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Are some channels more effective?\n",
      "   - Channels 1, 2, and 3 are all significant predictors of site visits (p < 0.05).\n",
      "   - R-squared for the model is 0.151, suggesting that 15.11% of the variance in site visits is explained by the channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Which demographics interact with exposure frequency?\n",
      "   - The interaction terms between income bins and exposure count are significant, indicating that the effect of exposure count on site visits varies by income level.\n",
      "   - R-squared for the interaction model is 0.280, suggesting that 28.04% of the variance in site visits is explained by these interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. How do different exposures interact (e.g., same ad multiple times, different ads)?\n",
      "   - Exposures to different ads (ad 1 and ad 2) are significant positive predictors of site visits (p < 0.05).\n",
      "   - R-squared for the exposure mix model is 0.148, suggesting that 14.81% of the variance in site visits is explained by the different ads.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. How do different exposures interact (e.g., same ad multiple times, different ads)?\n",
      "   - Exposures to different ads (ad 1 and ad 2) are significant positive predictors of site visits (p < 0.05).\n",
      "   - R-squared for the exposure mix model is 0.148, suggesting that 14.81% of the variance in site visits is explained by the different ads.\n",
      "   - The analysis shows that different ads independently drive site visits. The exposure count for each ad type is a significant factor, and their combined effect explains a substantial portion of the variance in site visits. This suggests that varying ad content can effectively increase engagement, supporting the strategy of using multiple ad versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Interaction Between Different Ads:\n",
      "\n",
      "   Ad 1 and Ad 2: The regression model includes exposure counts for different ads to see their combined effect on site visits.\n",
      "   Significant Positive Predictors: Both Ad 1 and Ad 2 exposure counts are significant predictors of site visits (p < 0.05). This means that seeing either ad increases the likelihood of site visits.\n",
      "   Additive Effect:\n",
      "\n",
      "   The model suggests an additive effect, where each additional exposure to either ad independently contributes to the total number of site visits.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Interpretation:\n",
      "   The model's coefficients for Ad 1 and Ad 2 exposures indicate how much each exposure type contributes to site visits. For example, if the coefficient for Ad 1 is 0.0618, then each additional exposure to Ad 1 increases the expected number of site visits by 0.0618, holding other factors constant.\n",
      "   The R-squared value for this model (0.148) suggests that 14.81% of the variance in site visits is explained by the combined exposures to different ads.\n"
